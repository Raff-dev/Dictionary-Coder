* ### About the algorithm
   LZ77 alhorithm was published in 1997 by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv, from who the name derives. It is a lossless data compression algorithm, 
   which keeps track of some amount of most recent data, and replaces repeated occurences with a pair of offset and length followed, by the next character.
